This repository contains filtered and/or aligned and/or processed SARS-CoV-2 sequences from ["SARS-CoV-2-Sequenzdaten aus Deutschland"](https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/SARS-CoV-2-Sequenzdaten_aus_Deutschland) by the German Robert-Koch-Institut, [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5139363](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5139363).

The underlying files that I use as input are licensed by RKI under CC-BY 4.0, see more details here: <https://github.com/robert-koch-institut/SARS-CoV-2-Sequenzdaten_aus_Deutschland#lizenz>.

The primary purpose of this repo is short-term data sharing with scientists and other interested parties.

 * `ba1_ba2`: Potential recombinants betweetn BA.1 and BA.2
 * `pot_rec.*`: Potential recombinants betweetn any lineages

Both were selected using [sc2rf (the SARS-Cov-2 Recombinant Finder)](https://github.com/lenaschimmel/sc2rf) and some (yet unreleased) helper scripts.
